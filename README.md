This is my project for ICS3U. I'm making it into my portfolio website.

Included is:
My adaptation of Pong from Atari
My animation of Pacman
My Platformer (which is a work in progress)
and my adaptation of Etch-A-Sketch

A program can run within an html file, like in StandAlonePong.html, or it can be referenced like in pong.html.
Main page is index.html. It has buttons that click through to all other games (like pong, platformer, ect.)
