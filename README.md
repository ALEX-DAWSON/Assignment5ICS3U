# I'M SORRY SOME OF THIS IS A MESS
This is my first attempt at making a website by myself that is using things like JavaScript and multiple branches and all those relatively fancy things :smile:
## To Do
- [x] Make the *player* in platformer be able to actually land on the platforms
- [x] Make an information displayer that references a bunch of random memes I don't understand

## OKAY! MEMES
