This is my project for ICS3U. I'm making it into my portfolio website.

Included is:
My adaptation of Pong from Atari
My animation of Pacman
My Platformer (which is a work in progress)
and my adaptation of Etch-A-Sketch by Andr√© Cassagnes


Main page is index.html. It has buttons that click through to all other games (like pong, platformer, ect.)
The setInterval command works by repeating a function (like next frame) a set amount of times every second (like 60 times a second).
A For loop works by repeating a set of commands every time a set of conditions is met.
